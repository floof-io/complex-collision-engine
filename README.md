# Pure JS Complex Polygon Collision Resolution Detection & Resolution
- Mildly optimized engine for detecting collisions between a circle and a complex polygon.
- Simple resolution as well.

## Known issues
- Collision between 3+ walls at once is weird
- Nullifying velocity causes collision entity stacking
